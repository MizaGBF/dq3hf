# Dragon Quest III: Heavenly Flight

Dragon Quest III: Heavenly Flight (DQ3HF) is a key item randomizer for Dragon Quest III for the SFC. This mod takes all the key items in the game for progression and shuffles them among existing locations in the game. The mod also randomizes the collectibles (chests, search areas and events) and shops. A few gameplay speed-up options such as EXP boost are present, and some systems have been tweaked for randomization such as the Small Medal system.
